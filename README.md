# Guide-github-pages
This is a guide to set up a github pages site 
<br />
[This is a example site](https://vokuar.github.io/template-webpage.io/) 
You can see a example here it [here](https://github.com/Vokuar/template-webpage.github.io) 
It's very simple
If you do not currently have a github account sign up a github account
Then make a new Repo called <website-name>.io
Then in settings go to pages and deploy a page from a branch
Then make a index.html in the root folder as seen in the example
And fill it with HTML code of your choice
